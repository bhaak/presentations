\frametitle{Junethack Timeline}
  \pause
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item late 2010, early 2011: ideas for a new NetHack tournament coming up on IRC
    \item early 2011: planning for achievements and trophies, some web mockups
    \item May 2011: actual code gets written
    \item June 2011: lots of code gets written. At that time, I get involved.
    \item June 2011: discussions about the name flare up -> decision: as long as it starts at least in \textbf{Ju}ly, it's fine
    \item 17th July 2011: start of the tournament (not all trophies implemented, but for preventing overlap with Crawl tournament and vicinity to devnull)
    \item 13th August 2011: last trophy implemented (1 day before tournament ends)
    \item 14th August 2011: tournamends ends
    \item 1st July 2012: second Junethack tournament starts
